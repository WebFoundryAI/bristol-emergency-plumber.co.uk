                <h2>Bristol's Most Trusted Emergency Plumbing Service</h2>
                <p>When a plumbing emergency strikes your Bristol home or business, every second counts. Water damage can escalate rapidly, turning a minor leak into a major disaster within minutes. That's precisely why our emergency plumbing service operates around the clock, ensuring that qualified help is always available when you need it most.</p>

                <p>Our team of emergency plumbers has been serving Bristol residents for over fifteen years, building an unmatched reputation for reliability and professionalism. We understand the stress and anxiety that comes with a plumbing emergency, which is why we've designed our service to be as responsive and reassuring as possible.</p>

                <h3>What Constitutes a Plumbing Emergency?</h3>
                <p>Not every plumbing issue requires immediate attention, but some situations demand urgent professional intervention. Our emergency service is designed to address:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Burst Pipes:</strong> Perhaps the most common plumbing emergency, a burst pipe can release hundreds of litres of water into your property within minutes. Whether caused by freezing temperatures, corrosion, or physical damage, burst pipes require immediate professional attention.</li>
                    <li><strong>Severe Flooding:</strong> When water is actively flooding your property from any source, immediate action is essential to minimise damage to your home and belongings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Gas Leaks:</strong> If you smell gas in your property, this constitutes a serious emergency. Our Gas Safe registered engineers can safely identify and repair gas leaks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Complete Loss of Water:</strong> Losing your water supply entirely can be both inconvenient and concerning, potentially indicating a serious problem with your plumbing system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sewage Backups:</strong> Raw sewage backing up into your property presents serious health hazards and requires immediate professional intervention.</li>
                    <li><strong>Boiler Failures in Cold Weather:</strong> During winter months, a complete heating failure can be dangerous, particularly for elderly residents or those with health conditions.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Our Emergency Response Process</h3>
