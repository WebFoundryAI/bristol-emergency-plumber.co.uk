                <h2>Quotes and Pricing</h2>
                <p>We provide quotes based on the information available at the time of assessment. Quotes are valid for 30 days unless otherwise stated. Final pricing may vary if:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>The scope of work changes at your request</li>
                    <li>Access to the work area is more difficult than anticipated</li>

                <h2>Payment Terms</h2>
                <p>Payment is due upon completion of work unless otherwise agreed in writing. We accept payment by cash, card, and bank transfer. For larger projects, we may require a deposit before commencing work.</p>

                <h2>Cancellations</h2>
                <p>Please provide at least 24 hours notice if you need to cancel or reschedule an appointment. Cancellations with less than 24 hours notice may incur a cancellation fee to cover costs incurred.</p>

                <h2>Access and Preparation</h2>
                <p>You agree to provide safe and reasonable access to the work area. Please ensure someone over 18 is present during the work. Clear the work area of personal belongings where possible to facilitate efficient service delivery.</p>

                <h2>Warranty</h2>
